# SWOP

## SWOP is a mini-app to translate of keyboard layout from russian to english and back.
It not my idea, to often i use [swoper.ru](https://swoper.ru/), but now i decide make my version in C# WPF.
I think it's easier because it doesn't need the internet and it has an intuitive interface (with hints)
